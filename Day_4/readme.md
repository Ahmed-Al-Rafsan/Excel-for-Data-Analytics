**Day 4 — Conditional Logic \& Business Analysis (Excel)**



On Day 4, I focused on applying conditional logic in Excel from a data analyst’s perspective.



Instead of repeating similar exercises, I intentionally avoided redundant tasks and validated that core concepts were already mastered. The emphasis was on understanding \*when\* and \*why\* to use conditional formulas rather than mechanical repetition.



**### Key Skills Practiced**

\- IF, Nested IF, and IFS for business classification

\- COUNTIF / SUMIF for single-condition analysis

\- COUNTIFS / SUMIFS for multi-condition business questions

\- Logical categorisation of transactions (High / Normal / Critical)

\- Profit vs Loss identification using conditional logic



**### Outcome**

This day strengthened decision-based thinking in Excel and ensured readiness to apply conditional formulas efficiently in real-world data analysis scenarios.

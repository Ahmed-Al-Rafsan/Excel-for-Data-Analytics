# Excel for Data Analytics – Mini Dashboard Project



This repository documents my job-focused Excel for Data Analytics learning journey, completed through a structured 10-day fast-track plan.



Instead of covering everything in Excel, the focus was on what data analysts actually use in real roles.



**Skills Covered**



Data cleaning (TRIM, SUBSTITUTE, REPLACE)



Essential formulas (IF, IFS, SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, text \& date functions)



PivotTables for aggregation and analysis



PivotCharts for trend analysis



Slicers for interactive filtering



KPI creation (Total Sales, Total Orders)



Building a clean, recruiter-ready Excel dashboard





**Final Dashboard Highlights**



KPIs: Total Sales \& Total Orders



Monthly Sales Trend (PivotChart)



Product Category slicer for interactivity



Backend PivotTables used safely to power visuals



Clean layout focused on clarity, not decoration







**Why This Project**



The goal was not to master Excel fully, but to:



Build analyst-level Excel confidence



Avoid over-engineering (no VBA, no macros)



Prepare for Power BI / Tableau next



Create portfolio-ready work recruiters can understand quickly

# \# Excel for Data Analytics - Day 01



This repository documents my step-by-step journey learning \*\*Excel for Data Analytics\*\* with a job-focused approach.



**## Day 01 – Foundations**

\- Worked with a real retail sales dataset

\- Ensured clean data structure (one row = one transaction)

\- Froze header row for usability

\- Performed basic analysis:

&nbsp; - Total Sales

&nbsp; - Average Sales

&nbsp; - Maximum \& Minimum Sales

\- Applied sorting and filtering for exploratory analysis



&nbsp;Focus: Analyst-ready habits, clean data, and real-world workflows.

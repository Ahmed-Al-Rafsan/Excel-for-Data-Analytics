In Day 8, I focused on creating analyst-ready visualizations using PivotTables and PivotCharts.



\### Key Visuals Created:

\- Category-wise Bar Chart (Sales comparison)

\- Monthly Line Chart (Sales trend over time)

\- Category-wise Pie Chart (Sales contribution %)



\### Skills Practiced:

\- PivotTables for aggregation

\- PivotCharts

\- Chart selection based on analytical purpose

These visualizations help convert summarized data into clear business insights.
